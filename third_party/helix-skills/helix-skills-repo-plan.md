# Helix Skills Repo Plan

This document turns the current Helix skills strategy into an execution checklist for a public `skills.sh` repository hosted under the `HelixDB` organization.

This repository is the planning and drafting workspace. The hosted skills repository will live separately under `HelixDB`.

## Goal

Ship a public skills repository that helps coding agents:

- write new Helix queries in the Rust DSL
- translate queries from Cypher, Gremlin, and SQL into the Rust DSL
- optimize Helix queries using real Helix storage and query-shape constraints
- run dynamic JSON queries correctly through `POST /v1/query`

The output should be practical, repo-aware, and grounded in real Helix patterns instead of generic graph-database advice.

## Target Outcome

After launch, users should be able to run:

```bash
npx skills add HelixDB/<repo-name>
```

and get a small set of high-signal skills that reliably help agents produce correct Helix query code.

## Product Decisions

### Skill Set

Initial public skills:

- `helix-query-authoring`
- `helix-query-from-cypher`
- `helix-query-from-gremlin`
- `helix-query-from-sql`
- `helix-query-optimize`
- `helix-query-json-dynamic`

Decision for v1:

- do not publish a separate `helix-query-core` skill yet
- keep shared guidance in repository docs and repeat only the essential rules inside each public `SKILL.md`

### Scope Boundaries

In scope:

- Rust DSL stored-query authoring guidance
- migration guidance from Cypher, Gremlin, and SQL
- dynamic endpoint request-shape guidance
- optimization guidance tied to Helix indexes, traversals, and runtime behavior
- benchmark cases and golden examples

Out of scope for v1:

- automatic query conversion tooling
- code generation CLIs
- non-Rust SDK skills
- generic graph modeling advice that is not Helix-specific
- MCP-only skills

### Authoring Principles

- Keep each skill narrow enough that agents can choose it confidently from the description alone.
- Keep `SKILL.md` focused on when to use the skill, how to work, what to avoid, and where to look next.
- Put bulky examples, rosetta tables, and benchmark fixtures in sibling docs.
- Ground every skill in existing Helix code and tests.
- Prefer exact Helix terminology over broad database jargon.

## Source Canon

These are the primary references the skills should cite and draw examples from.

### Repo-Local Canonical References

- `docs/source-canon.md`
- `docs/dsl-cheatsheet.md`
- `docs/cypher-rosetta.md`
- `docs/gremlin-rosetta.md`
- `docs/dynamic-query-examples.md`
- `docs/optimization-checklist.md`
- `examples/authoring-patterns.md`
- `examples/search-patterns.md`
- `examples/optimization-patterns.md`

### Helix Docs

- `https://skills.sh/docs`
- `https://opencode.ai/docs/skills`
- `https://docs.helix-db.com/database/working-with-enterprise`
- `https://docs.helix-db.com/documentation/hql/traversals`
- `https://docs.helix-db.com/documentation/hql/conditionals`
- `https://docs.helix-db.com/documentation/hql/result_ops`
- `https://docs.helix-db.com/documentation/hql/output_values`
- `https://docs.helix-db.com/documentation/hql/vectors`
- `https://docs.helix-db.com/documentation/hql/keyword_search`

### Publication Rule

- do not publish machine-local filesystem paths as source pointers
- do not treat app-specific implementations as canonical Helix references
- convert any implementation-derived idea into a generic documented pattern before publishing it here
- prefer the repo-local canon over public docs when this repo is intentionally teaching a newer supported Helix capability

## Critical Helix Facts The Skills Must Teach

- Stored Rust DSL queries are the normal production path.
- Dynamic inline queries are supported, but they deserialize at request time and are less optimized than stored routes.
- Dynamic queries go to `POST /v1/query`.
- Dynamic query bodies must contain a single inline route object under `query`, not the entire `queries.json` bundle.
- Dynamic `request_type` must be `read` or `write`.
- Dynamic queries do not support `mcp` request type.
- `parameter_types` is required when callers need type-aware coercion, especially `DateTime` and typed arrays.
- Stored routes can inherit parameter typing from router metadata; dynamic routes must provide it explicitly.
- `Bytes` parameters are not representable through the JSON query route.
- Text search in enterprise is property-scoped.
- Vector and text indexes are often tenant-scoped and queries should preserve that scope.
- BM25 patterns may need over-fetch then post-filter then trim.
- Repeat depth in the current DSL patterns is often fixed at compile time.

## Skill Template Contract

Every skill should include:

- YAML frontmatter with `name` and a very specific `description`
- a short statement of what the skill does
- explicit usage triggers
- a mandatory workflow the agent should follow
- Helix-specific rules and anti-patterns
- links to adjacent docs in the repo
- a small validation checklist

Each `description` should be written for discoverability. It should include the source task phrasing the user is likely to use.

## Example Packs

### `examples/authoring-patterns.md`

Use as the generic CRUD, traversal, and write-branching example pack.

### `examples/search-patterns.md`

Use as the generic BM25, vector, and bounded-expansion example pack.

### `examples/optimization-patterns.md`

Use as the generic before-and-after optimization example pack.

## Benchmark Plan

The benchmark suite should validate whether the skills actually improve agent outputs.

Each benchmark case should contain:

- a prompt
- the expected skill to trigger
- the expected repo files an agent should inspect
- the expected output shape
- one or more gold answers
- a checklist for scoring

Each scoring sheet should cover:

- correct read or write choice
- correct labels, edges, and property names
- correct anchor choice
- correct tenant scope
- correct traversal direction
- correct projection and return shape
- correct dynamic request envelope when relevant
- correct `parameter_types` usage when relevant
- index-awareness where appropriate

## Suggested Next Move

Start with the hosted repo `README.md`, `docs/source-canon.md`, and `skills/helix-query-authoring/SKILL.md` first. Those three pieces will define the tone and working pattern for everything else.
